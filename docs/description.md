### Wedding Site Project Description

The wedding site is designed to provide an engaging and efficient platform for managing wedding event details, guest interactions, and logistical needs. It focuses on creating a functional and visually appealing user experience, catering to both the invited guests and the administrators managing the event. It gives guests a simple way to RSVP, book accommodations, and find all the important details about the day. At the same time, it provides tools for administrators to manage guest lists, track room bookings, and keep everything organized.

The site also allows guests to share photos and updates, creating a space where everyone can connect and celebrate the wedding together. Itâ€™s designed to look great and work smoothly, ensuring a positive experience for everyone involved.

### Functional Scope
The project ensures that both functionality and design are prioritized to deliver a seamless and visually appealing experience for users. Media and file uploads will be handled by a dedicated service to isolate potential issues and maintain application stability. The entire platform will operate in Bulgarian.

The system will rely on Docker Compose for service orchestration and cloud hosting for scalability and reliability, supporting microservices for specific functionalities like content handling and email notifications.
